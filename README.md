# School_District_Analysis_Challenge
Analyzing standardized testing data to determine if academic dishonesty is occurring at a notable scale

## Overview and Purpose
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze standardized testing data with and without Thomas High School 9th Grade data to determine if metrics become skewed by a statistically significant amount upon expunging.

### Project Overview
By performing a multitude of analytical operations on the data both with and without the 9th grader data, it is possible to examine meta-trends within the student and school performance to weigh likelihood of academic dishonesty.

## Results

### School Summary
Interestingly, when we remove the 9th grader data, the overall school performance jumps somewhat to over 90% in all fields. This increases its competitiveness with other schools

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
Both math and reading scores are increased by a small number of percentage points when hte 9th grader testing data is expunged from Thomas High School

### School Performance by Spending
Due to the increaseed school-level performance, a follow on effect is that the spending bracket the school is apart of becomes more competitive relative to other spending brackets

### School Performance by Size
Similar to performance by spending -- the size bracket THS is a part of increases its relative performance due to the increased school-level results

### School Performance by Type
Yet again, due to the increase in testing scores in THS's individual case, the category of school to which THS falls under also receives a boost in performance.
